# React + TypeScript + Vite + Next.js

## React
- React library is for building interactive UIs.
## Next.js Fundamentals

Next.js is a framework for building fast and search-engine friendly applications.

```
 A framework = library + tools + conventions.
```



- Compiler `Transform & minify JS code`
- CLI `Build & start apps`
- Node.js runtime `--Is a programme that can excute JS code,
--It also allow us to rener our cmponent on the server and send their content to the client which is called server-side rendering`

### Techniques
- Server side-rendering `fast Search-engine friendly`
- Static Site Generation `Fast`

* Dynamic typing and Static typing also knows as dynamically typed and statically typed.

### Dynamically typed: means the type of variables can be change at runtime

2. Statically typed: means the type of variables that cannot change once its declared.

# Advantage of dynamically typed
1. In dynamically typed language, type errors are only dicovered at runtime, which can lead to unecpected crashes and bugs.

# Advantage of statically typed
1. statically typed language promotes type safety and detects errors at an early stage.


* (Go is a language that's statically typed.)

* (Interpreter reads code and translates it line by line into what's known as machine code or byte code.)

(Compiler catches type-related errors before the program runs, leading to more reliable code.)

## Rendering Environments
- `Client` web Browser
- `Client-side  rendering`
- Large bundles
- Resource intensive
- No SEO
- Less secure
- `Server` Node.js Runtime
- `Server-side rendering`
- Smaller bundles
- Resource efficient
- SEO
- More Secure

### Server Components cannot
- Listen to browser events
- Access Browser APIs
- Maintain state
- Use effects

### Two ways to fetch Data
- Client
- Server

### Static and Dynamic rendering
- static rendering  or static side generation: Rendering at build time
- Dynamic rendering: Rendering at request time
